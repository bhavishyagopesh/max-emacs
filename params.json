That's a perfectly sane question. Ideally, you should be cloning this repo, and then pulling necessary things into your Emacs config.\r\n\r\nStill, if you want the easy way, here's it:\r\nSimple, backup your ```.emacs.d``` folder, pull this repo in there. Done.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd ~\r\ncp -r .emacs.d .emacs.old\r\nmv .emacs .emacs.oldcfg\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sakshamsharma/max-emacs\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason, the package `neotree` doesn't get loaded automatically. You'd need to do `M-x package-install [Ret] neotree` to install it.\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n+ Blazing fast! Despite having dozens of packages, Emacs starts up in less than 1.5 seconds.\r\n+ Tailor-configured for Haskell, JavaScript, Scala and others. Works great with many other languages.\r\n+ Modular. All elisp code is split into files named according to what the code does.\r\n+ [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) and [Avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) make life so much easier!\r\n+ An awesome powerline modeline, with many packages to improve it's look.\r\n+ Package management as a simple list of packages.\r\n+ The awesome spacemacs theme! (Not to forget, the spaceline theme to go with it)\r\n",
