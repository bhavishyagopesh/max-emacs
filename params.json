That's a perfectly sane question. Ideally, you should be cloning this repo, and then pulling necessary things into your Emacs config.\r\n\r\nStill, if you want the easy way, here's it:\r\nSimple, backup your ```.emacs.d``` folder, pull this repo in there. Done.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd ~\r\ncp -r .emacs.d .emacs.old\r\ncp .emacs .emacs.oldcfg\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sakshamsharma/max-emacs\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n+ Tailor-configured for Haskell. Works great with Javascript, Dart and C++. Other languages would be added as and when needed :)\r\n+ Modular. All elisp code is split into files named according to what the code does.\r\n+ [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) and [Ace-jump](https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode) make life so much easier!\r\n+ An awesome powerline modeline, with many packages to improve it's look.\r\n+ Package management as a simple list of packages.\r\n+ The awesome spacemacs theme!\r\n+ The fact that this all was written by a person one month into EMacs, and thus is simple to read :smile:\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
